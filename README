*******************************
Important !!!!
*******************************

Before submitting your program on sakai, rename it to YourLastName_mm.c (replace your last name with YourLastName) and submit. Please do not submit a program named mm.c, it will result in a score of 0.


***********
Main Files:
***********

mm.{c,h}	
	Your solution malloc package. mm.c is the file that you
	will be handing in, and is the only file you should modify. Change the file name to YourLastName_mm.c before submitting it on Sakai. Submission of a single file named mm.c will result in a score of 0.

mdriver.c	
	The malloc driver that tests your mm.c file

short{1,2}-bal.rep
	Two tiny tracefiles to help you get started. 

Makefile	
	Builds the driver

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************

config.h	Configures the malloc lab driver
fsecs.{c,h}	Wrapper function for the different timer packages
clock.{c,h}	Routines for accessing the Pentium and Alpha cycle counters
fcyc.{c,h}	Timer functions based on cycle counters
ftimer.{c,h}	Timer functions based on interval timers and gettimeofday()
memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function

tmp folder  To store the temporary folder when you run the command ./grade-malloclab.pl -f ./mm.c
traces folder   Trace files to be used for testing your program
grade-malloclab.pl      This is the malloc lab's autograder.  To run the autograder:
                                        unix> ./grade-malloclab.pl -f ./mm.c 


*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver -V -f short1-bal.rep

The -V option prints out helpful tracing and summary information.

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> ./mdriver -h

*******************************
Evaluating your program
*******************************
To help you evaluate your program, we add the autograder in the handout folder. To evaluate your program, do:


	unix> ./grade-malloclab.pl -f ./mm.c


If your program satisfies all the requirements, you will see the following:

Part 3: Grade

Correctness:  20  /  20 
Performance:  35  /  35 
Style:            /  10
